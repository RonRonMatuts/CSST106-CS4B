  <h3>What is Computer Vision?</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the   visual world. By processing digital images from cameras and videos, computer vision systems aim to perform tasks that are usually associated with human vision.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Techniques used to enhance, manipulate, and analyze images. It involves the use of algorithms to process digital images to improve their quality or extract useful information.</p>

  <h3>Image Processing Techniques</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Filtering:</strong> A technique used to enhance or suppress specific features in an image. Examples include smoothing (to reduce noise) and sharpening (to enhance details).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Edge Detection:</strong> Methods used to identify the boundaries of objects within an image. Techniques such as the Sobel operator or Canny edge detector help in detecting changes in intensity that signify edges.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Segmentation:</strong> The process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify the analysis. Techniques include thresholding (separating objects from the background) and clustering (grouping similar pixels).</p>

  <h3>Case Study Selection</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Facial Recognition Systems:</strong> AI systems designed to identify or verify individuals based on facial features. These systems often use techniques such as feature extraction and pattern recognition.</p>
  
 <h4>Facial recognition systems use computer vision to identify or verify individuals based on their facial features. Here’s a simplified explanation of how it works:</h4>

 <p><strong>1. Image Capture:</strong> The system captures an image of a face using a camera. This can be a live feed or a still   image.</p>

 <p><strong>2. Face Detection:</strong> The system detects and locates the face within the image. This involves identifying the    face's position and boundaries.</p>

 <p><strong>3. Feature Extraction:</strong> The facial features are extracted from the detected face. These features include the   distance between eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contour of the jawline.</p>

 <p><strong>4. Feature Represenation:</strong> The extracted features are converted into a numerical representation, often called  a facial embedding or faceprint. This is a unique set of values that represents the face’s distinct characteristics.</p>

 <p><strong>5. Comparison Matching:</strong> The facial embedding is compared against a database of known faceprints. The system   searches for a match or verifies if the face matches an individual’s stored profile.</p>

 <p><strong>6. Decision Making:</strong> Based on the comparison, the system determines if the face matches any known identity or  if it’s an unknown individual.</p>
   
<h4>Facial recognition systems rely on sophisticated algorithms and machine learning models to accurately detect and recognize faces, even under varying lighting conditions, angles, and expressions.</h4>
